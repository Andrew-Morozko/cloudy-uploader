# 1.1.0

- Configurable ordered submission of uploads to Overcast server:

Overcast used to order the `Uploads` feed by date of submission of the file to the Overcast server.
Because of this `cloudyuploader` submitted the uploaded files in strict order, otherwise they showed up in a mixed up.

While I wasn't looking Marco changed the ordering of `Uploads` feed: now it's ordered by the file name.
However, the upload date still is used in some places. It definitely controls the order of
[Recent Episodes](https://overcast.fm/podcasts) on the web, and may be used in playlist ordering (didn't check that).

Because of that there's a new option `--unordered-submit`. It speeds up uploads somewhat, but file upload dates
become disordered.

- Massive refactoring, now `cloudyuploader` resembles maintainable code.
- Probably some new and exciting bugs. This is a homebrew automation project, not a properly structured application. Sorry ðŸ˜”
