# Cloudy Uploader
*Unofficial CLI client for [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/)Â® Premium upload feature*

It's just a wrapper around upload a form at [https://overcast.fm/uploads](https://overcast.fm/uploads).

I wanted to automate the uploading of my mp3s to my favorite podcast player and decided to share it here.
Sorry for the code quality, this is also my first go project. It works, whatever;) Issues and pull requests are welcome.

This project shouldn't cause any trouble, but I (of course) will shut it down if Marco isn't ok with it.
